# Predicting FZG test Failure Load Stage
FZG Random Forest regression and classification prediciton model. 

Developed a precise and accurate Random Forest predictive model that predicts FZG (Forschungsstelle fur Zahnrader und Getriebebau - gear test) Failure Load Stage. The model passed Formulator Tool Kit publication criteria, enabling better, faster, cheaper product development for the “Driveline” business unit. The model increased prediction accuracy 26.22% above the No Information Rate (NIR of 53.8%) to 80% and exceeded precision requirements of RMSE (1.12) > 2*Test Precision (0.8267) by 0.54.
